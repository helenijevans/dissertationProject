This repository shows the current state of the project, a Mandarin Chinese language learning app with an emphasis on allowing users to test their writing.

The current master branch is an app that can draw Chinese Characters and then save them on a mobile device. These images will be used to create the initial dataset (dimensions: 485x485). 

Issue to Fix: App is called createDataset at present, needs to change to reflect different (or at least final) state
